# Summary of the capston project proposal
[proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WrAO6wCVBD7zUqU_YKff3MjiQHl_E-YJaxXQ2UolNh0/edit?usp=sharing)
Datasets and inputs
1. The tasting data set used is from the Kaggle wine dataset version 41 by the magazine Winemag2.
2. Temperature data is from Kaggle Global Warming database by @berkeleyearth3.
3. GPS coordinates is extracted from Geopy library 201810

Usage instruction

Please view Report.pdf for the details about the result and analysis for the project.

To replicate result
1. install required packages ```pip install -r ./requirements.txt```
2. run all the cells in ./wine_review_ai/data_pre_processing.ipynb
3. for the data exploration reproduction run data exploration.ipynb
4. for ratio model run ./wine_review_ai/ratio_output_models.ipynb
5. for classification mode run ./wine_review_ai/classification_models.ipynb
